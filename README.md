# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Data Science & Flask  

This project detects plant diseases using machine learning and provides a **Flask-based web interface** for users to upload images and get predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Image Classification**: Identifies plant diseases from leaf images.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**.  
- **Flask Web App**: Simple UI to upload images and view predictions.  
- **Preprocessing**: Uses **OpenCV** for image processing.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (for web framework)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for model training)  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (for frontend)  

## 📊 Dataset  
- Dataset: *[Dataset Name]*  
- Source: *[Kaggle/Custom Dataset Link]*  
- Contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
